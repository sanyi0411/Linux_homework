# Linux_homework
Hi,

During my Computer Enginnering studies I took a Linux course. Our homework was to come up with a unique idea, a programming project where we would use the knowledge we learned during the course and implement it.

For this I chose to write a bash script that every night pulls a specific repository from Github, containing C++ files, runs g++ to build them and sends email to certain people whether the build was successful or not. Also the script should update an html file, so the past reports can be viewed at any time.

The documentation for this project can be found at the Wiki section of this repo.
